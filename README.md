# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

🚀 Exciting news! I've just launched my passion project: a coffee e-commerce website ☕️. I'm thrilled to share this journey with you all!

✨ Designed with love and attention to detail, the website boasts a beautiful and intuitive user interface. Powered by React.js and styled with Tailwind CSS, navigating through our diverse coffee blends and placing orders has never been easier.

🔒 Prioritizing your security and privacy, I've implemented Firebase authentication. This ensures that each transaction is secure and personalized. Before placing an order, users are required to log in, adding an extra layer of protection.

🔄 Leveraging Redux for state management, I've meticulously managed all the data, ensuring seamless interaction and responsiveness throughout the website. Additionally, I've developed custom hooks for fetching data, optimizing performance, and enhancing user experience.

🛠️ Tech Stack:

React.js
Tailwind CSS
Firebase
React Router
Skeleton (for shimmer UI)
Toastify (for popups)
Redux (for state management)
🛍️ This project is more than just an e-commerce website. It's a reflection of my dedication and passion for coffee. With features like adding and deleting items, adjusting quantities, and even selecting coffee flavors, I've crafted an experience tailored to coffee lovers like myself.
